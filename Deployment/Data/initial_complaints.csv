The response from XXXX and XXXX  was that it was verified through their third partner XXXX. That can not be correct because I have a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX account since XX/XX/XXXX. which no one can obtain my report for anything until I unfreeze it.  I wrote XXXX and XXXX a second letter and mailed them on XX/XX/2019 telling them that they have lied when they said that they verified the two accounts in question using XXXX because I have a freeze on my account and when I called XXXX on XX/XX/2019 they stated that no one has requested or attempted access to my account this year. I told them that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. Only XXXX wrote back a letter dated XX/XX/2019 stating that XXXX verified the accounts and that I should talk to them if I have a complaint.     Trans Union never responded to my letter dated XX/XX/2019 to verifiy the two accounts in question since and the 30 plus days to investigate my claim has been expired.

They had indicated a shortage to my escrow account in the loan modification documents. I was provided different information every time I spoke on the phone with a XXXX   representative. One would say I had an overage, others would say I had a shortage. The modification documents indicated at {$1900.00} shortage. I called, I emailed and wrote letters, I requested a Escrow review of my account in XXXX and XXXX and was told one would be done. They kept delaying and I finally had to sign the Modification documents on XX/XX/XXXX under duress otherwise the Modification would be withdrawn. No review of my escrow was ever done by XXXX, I discovered what appears to be an error when I reviewed the two Escrow Disclosure statements from XXXX for XXXX and XXXX. The Escrow balance for XX/XX/XXXX shows an actual escrow balance of {$2200.00}, the next statement shows a XXXX actual balance for XXXX, a difference of XXXX when only XXXX should have been withdrawn from this account to pay for the monthly mortgage insurance. I have recently contacted by phone and email to XXXX and they have not responded.     In XX/XX/XXXX my loan servicing was transferred to Mr Cooper ( Formerly Nationstar Mortgage. ) ( Account # XXXX ). Mr Cooper did do a escrow analysis in XXXX of XXXX. That analysis was completely mishandled and they indicate a shortage of XXXX in my account. Even though my account is currently at a XXXX deficit as of XX/XX/XXXX. Their major errors was their analysis to my Hazard insurance and Morgage insurance. They indicated the Hazard insurance was XXXX last year ( when it was actually XXXX ) and this year the correct amount of XXXX. The Mortgage insurance they again misquoted last year at XXXX ( the actual was XXXX ) and listed this year the correct amount at XXXX so they are showing a difference from last year to this year of XXXX increase. This is totally wrong. They are demanding the difference be paid in a lump sum or have my monthly payment increased to cover the shortage over a year period. I have contacted Mr Cooper by phone on  XX/XX/XXXX and was told someone would look at it but no one from their Escrow will call, just an email. I have also sent a letter stating the error. The new charges will be taking effect in XXXX so something needs to happen quickly. The simple facts are that my Hazard insurance has gone down from XXXX to XXXX. My taxes did go up from XXXX to XXXX, so the net effect of the two is only XXXX. I am already paying one shortage based on XXXX miscalculation and that was to be spread out over 5 years.  I want both XXXX and Mr Copper to correct the errors made to my escrow account and have XXXX send the deficiency to Mr Cooper post haste.

Debt Collection,Loans,Loans,Card Services,Loans,2021-06-15T17:13:57+00:00,"Summary of Issue : JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( Chase Auto ) has reported account delinquencies for a closed auto lease account without notifying me of any amount being owed and they have continued to refuse to provide an invoice or statement to me for the amount supposedly owed. The credit bureaus have since downgraded my credit rating and the delinquency is published on my credit reports.     Description of dispute : I entered into a 36-month vehicle lease with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as assignee ) on XX/XX/XXXX. I made all 36 monthly payments associated with this account in-full, returned the leased vehicle on-time, and I have never received notice of an additional amount being owed via mail, electronic mail, or otherwise. My account with Chase closed the day that I returned the leased car and I have not received a statement since I returned the car to the XXXX dealership.     On XX/XX/XXXX, the day before I was due to leave on my honeymoon, I received a notification from my XXXX  credit monitoring service that Chase had reported a past-due balance of {$1600.00} on my Chase account and that the account was at least 30 days delinquent. I had no knowledge of what this {$1600.00} debt consists of. As a direct result of these negative reports to the credit bureaus, my credit score was lowered by 106 points.     When I discovered the negative reports, I immediately submitted a dispute to XXXX, but Chase only confirmed to XXXX the existence of the debt, which does not resolve the issue. A review of the online portal for the closed Chase account on XX/XX/XXXX revealed no current statements.     I notified Chase by letter on XX/XX/XXXX that a delinquency was reported to the credit bureaus for a debt that I have never received a bill for and I requested a statement of the amount owed. I received a letter response from Chase on XX/XX/XXXX wherein they only stated that they reported an outstanding debt.

I had been working full time as an employee for XXXX  XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX.  On XX/XX/XXXX I received a rejection letter from XXXX XXXX stating that my current loans were not eligible for the PSLF program.  On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX and asked what I needed to do to have my loans qualify for the PSLF program. The customer service representative at that time said I needed to consolidate my current loans with my current lender at the time ( XXXX  ) in order to have them qualify for the PSLF program through XXXX XXXX XXXX.  I then called my current lender at the time and started the process of consolidating my Direct Stafford loans and they were officially consolidated on XX/XX/XXXX.  I then reapplied for the PSLF program and was accepted. My loans were officially transferred to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX.  At this time I had already been working for a XXXX job for six years and had been in repayment status for my student loans. All those qualifying payments over those six years should have been applied to my PSLF repayment schedule.  I then received an email in XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX stating that I could view the amount of qualifying payments that were applied to my PSLF over the course of the last year. When I went to check I expected to see an accumulation of 7 years of payments, but there were only the payments I had made since my loans had officially transferred to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX.     I then called XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to see why there were not more payments applied to my running balance for the PSLF and I was informed by a customer representative from XXXX XXXX that when I consolidated my loans prior to transferring them to XXXX XXXX that it null and voided any previous payments I had made on those loans.  I was extremely upset, because the only reason I applied for the PSLF program is because I knew I had 6 years of payments that would set me up well to have my loans paid off in the 10 years or 120 payments whichever came first. If I would of known that consolidating my loans would null all those qualifying payments I WOULD OF NEVER DONE THAT. No one from XXXX  educated me on this crucial point.  I then spoke to another representative from XXXX XXXX on that same day because I could not wrap my head around why I was told to consolidate when this would start me completely over on my repayment. I was then told directly from the customer service representative on XX/XX/XXXX that I was misinformed from XXXX XXXX and wrongly sent a denial letter that stated my loans were not eligible when in fact my Direct Stafford loans were eligible for the program and they did not need to be consolidated prior to transferring.  I am seeking to have this fixed and to have my payments that I made over those six years prior to being told I had to consolidate applied to my running balance of my payments for my PSLF.  This whole situation makes XXXX XXXX look extremely devious and further enforces the stigma around the PSLF program and why people are so frustrated with the process.
